      <h5>Background information:</h5>        
      <p  style="text-align:justify;">The internationalisation in many companies and projects requires a better understanding of
working conditions in different cultures to enable an enhanced integration of employees in
foreign working environments.</p>
      <p  style="text-align:justify;">We now know that the motivation, well-being and performance of employees are increasing
if the individual needs are considered in the workplace design process. The challenge
therefore is how to bring several individual needs into a multinational workplace as a factor
of promoting integration and well-being of every employee equally.</p>
        <p  style="text-align:justify;">Our goal is the identification of different (working) types and success factors on a global
scale. On this basis, recommendations and suggestions for a workspace design of
multinational working environments are derived.</p>
        <p  style="text-align:justify;">By participating in our survey of <strong> about 5 minutes </strong>you can help us explore complex
interdependencies and make an important contribution to create equal working conditions
for employees from all cultural backgrounds.</p>
        <p  style="text-align:justify;">Thank you for taking the time to do this â€“ your responses are really invaluable.</p>
