            point in time I have the right to quit the survey or withdraw my data without the need of any
            motivation. The purpose and aim of the study is made clear to me. My retrieved data will be
            aggregated to group level, evaluated and published for scientific and educational purposes
            and will not be shared with third parties under any circumstances. When the research
            process is completed, my individual records will be deleted by the research team. If the data
            will be made public in anyway, all personal information will be completely anonymized.</p>

                The personal data collected is not transferred to countries outside the EU/EEA. The survey software from Unipark/Questback GmbH stores your personal data exclusively in Germany. A data transfer to a country or international organisation outside the EU/EEA is excluded.</p>

                <p  style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Statutory or contractual requirement</strong><br>
                Without exception, participation in the following online survey is voluntary. There is no legal or contractual provision that justifies participation.</p>
        
        
                <p  style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Automated decision making</strong><br>
                    You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, that has legal effect on you or significantly affects you in a similar manner. This shall not apply if the decision</p>
                        <ul class="counter-increment">
                            <li>is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between you and the person responsible</li>
                            <li>is authorised by Union or national legislation to which the responsible person is subject and that legislation provides for appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests; or</li>
                            <li>with your express consent.</li>

                        </ul>
                <p  style="text-align:justify;">However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of personal data pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO, unless Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a or g DSGVO applies and appropriate measures have been taken to protect rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests. With regard to the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the data controller shall take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests, which shall include at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person from the data controller, to present his or her point of view and to challenge the decision.</p>      



            <p  style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Your individual rights</strong><br>
                If your personal data is processed, you are affected within the meaning of the DSGVO and you are entitled to the following rights in relation to the person responsible:

                    <ol>
                        <li>right of information </li>
                            You can request confirmation from the responsible person as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed by us. If such processing is carried out, you may request information from the data controller on the following:<br>
                            <ul class="counter-increment">
                                    <li>the purposes for which the personal data are processed</li>
                                    <li>  the categories of personal data which are processed</li>
                                    <li> the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been or will be disclosed</li>
                                    <li> the planned duration of the storage of the personal data concerning you or, if it is not possible to give specific details, criteria for determining the duration of storage</li>
                                    <li> the existence of a right of rectification or erasure of personal data concerning you, a right to have the processing limited by the controller or a right to object to such processing</li>
                                    <li> the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority</li>
                                    <li> any available information as to the source of the data, if the personal data are not collected from the data subject</li><br>
                                    <p  style="text-align:justify;">the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with Art. 22 (1) and (4) DPA and, at least in these cases, meaningful information on the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing on the data subject.
                                        You have the right to request information as to whether the personal data concerning you are being transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. In this context, you may request to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 DPA in connection with the transfer.
                                        This right of information may be limited to the extent that it is likely to make the realisation of the research or statistical purposes impossible or to seriously prejudice them and the limitation is necessary for the fulfilment of the research or statistical purposes.</p></ul>


                    <li>right of rectification</li>
                            You have the right to ask the data controller to correct and/or complete any inaccurate or incomplete personal data processed concerning you. The data controller shall make the rectification without delay. Your right of rectification may be limited to the extent that it is likely to make it impossible or seriously hinder the achievement of the research or statistical purposes and the limitation is necessary for the achievement of the research or statistical purposes.

                    <li>right to limit processing</li>
                        Under the following conditions, you may request the restriction of the processing of personal data concerning you:<ul class="counter-increment">
                        <li>if you dispute the accuracy of the personal data concerning you for a period which enables the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data</li>
                        <li> if the processing is unlawful and you object to the deletion of the personal data and instead request the restriction of the use of the personal data</li>
                        <li> the data controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you need the personal data for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims; or</li>
                        <li>if you have lodged an objection to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 para. 1 DPA and it has not yet been established whether the legitimate reasons given by the controller outweigh your reasons.</li></ul>
                            If the processing of personal data relating to you has been restricted, such data - apart from being stored - may be processed only with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or on grounds of an important public interest of the Union or a Member State.
                        If the restriction on processing has been limited in accordance with the above conditions, you will be informed by the data controller before the restriction is lifted.
                        Your right to limit processing may be limited to the extent that it is likely to make it impossible or seriously prejudicial to the achievement of the research or statistical purposes and that the limitation is necessary for the achievement of the research or statistical purposes.

                        <li>right of cancellation</li>
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                            <li>Duty to delete</li>
  
                                    <p  style="text-align:justify;">You may request the responsible person to delete personal data relating to you without delay and the responsible person shall be obliged to delete such data without delay if one of the following reasons applies:</p>
                                    <ul class="counter-increment"> <li>the personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed</li>
                                        <li>You revoke your consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a FADP, and there is no other legal basis for the processing.</li>
                                        <li>You lodge an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21(1) DPA and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for the processing, or you lodge an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21(2) DPA.</li>
                                        <li>The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully.</li>
                                        <li>The deletion of personal data relating to you is necessary to comply with a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States to which the controller is subject.</li>
                                        <li>The personal data concerning you have been collected in relation to information society services offered in accordance with Article 8(1) of the DPA.</li></ul>

                            <li>Information to third parties</li>
                                If the data controller has made public the personal data relating to you and is obliged to delete them pursuant to Art. 17 para. 1 DPA, it shall take reasonable measures, including technical measures, taking into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to inform data controllers who process the personal data that you, as a data subject, have requested them to delete all links to these personal data or copies or replications of these personal data.

                                <li> Exceptions</li>
                                The right of cancellation does not exist insofar as the processing is necessary<ul class="counter-increment">
                                <li>on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information</li>
                                <li>in order to comply with a legal obligation to which the processing relates under Union or national law to which the controller is subject or in order to perform a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller</li>
                                <li>for reasons of public interest in the field of public health pursuant to Article 9 (2) lit. h and i and Article 9 (3) DSGVO</li>
                                <li> for archival, scientific or historical research purposes in the public interest or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 para. 1 DSGVO, insofar as the right referred to in section a) is likely to render impossible or seriously prejudice the attainment of the objectives of such processing, or
                                <li> to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</li></ul>
                        </ol>
                        <li> right to information</li>
                        If you have exercised the right to rectify, erase or limit the processing, the data controller is obliged to notify all recipients* to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this rectification, erasure or limitation of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed of these recipients by the data controller.

                        <li> right to data transferability</li>
                        You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided to the responsible person in a structured, common and machine-readable format. You also have the right to have this data communicated to another responsible person without hindrance by the responsible person to whom the personal data has been made available, provided that<ul class="counter-increment"> 
                        <li> the processing is based on a consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter a DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 letter a DSGVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter b DSGVO and </li>
                        <li> the processing is carried out by means of automated procedures.</li></ul>
                        <p  style="text-align:justify;">In exercising this right, you also have the right to obtain that the personal data concerning you be transferred directly from one controller to another controller, insofar as this is technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons must not be affected by this. The right to data transferability shall not apply to processing of personal data which is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller.</p>
                        <p  style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Your right to withdraw consent</strong><br>
                            You have the right to revoke your data protection declaration of consent at any time. Revocation of your consent does not affect the legality of the processing that has taken place on the basis of your consent until revocation.</p>
                        <p  style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Supervisory authority</strong><br>
                            Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State in which you are resident, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data concerning you is in breach of the DPA.<br>
                            The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Art. 78 DSGVO.</p>
